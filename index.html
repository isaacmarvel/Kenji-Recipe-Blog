        <h1>A Few of My Favorite Recipes From the Great J. Kenji Lopez-Alt</h1>
            <p class="intro">I've been cooking in some capacity since I was barely old enough for it to be safe--early on it was a lot of eggs and deer (my dad's an avid hunter, and I was a hungry kid), 
                and not too much later on I was helping my Granny make Thanksgiving meals. At least, I hope I was being helpful... In any case, I've come a long way, for sure, and
                these days I would consider myself a halfway decent home cook. And I can safely say that, as  of the last few years, the single most helpful cooking resource I've found
                is the work of Kenji. His hyper-scientific approach to cooking challenges assumptions that the entire western world has been making (heard of a reverse-seared steak? That's all Kenji).
                So, to honor his work, I've taken it upon myself to collect a few of my most-used Kenji recipes, so you can try them out for yourself and see what you've been missing.

            <h2>Easy Fried Rice</h2>

                    When I found this recipe I was no stranger to making fried rice, but I was never quite satisfied with the end result. I'd tried the old trick of using day old rice,
                    I had bought sesame oil to finish it with, I'd tried different kinds of rice, but it just didn't end up tasting, well, fried. It was more like flavored rice with eggs and veggies, 
                    which was good, mind you, but not really what I was going for. This recipe taught me what I was missing--enormous amounts of heat. I couldn't believe, when I first read this recipe, 
                    that he gets the whole thing cooked in a matter of a few minutes. It really just comes down to getting your pan as hot as possible and almost flash frying your rice--not 
                    overcrowding your pan obviously helps with this, especially if you don't have the hottest burners in the world. In the end, it's fast, easy, and delicious.

            <h2>Colombian Chicken Stew</h2>
                <img src="https://www.seriouseats.com/thmb/H4-usCoU14LzGKY_fXi1OSF40XQ=/880x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__serious_eats__seriouseats.com__recipes__images__2012__05__20120530-chicken-colombian-potato-tomato-3-9b64ce63fba54a73b726de3c1ee3f33c.jpg" alt="Colombian chicken stew image">

                        Funnily enough, Kenji's wife actually taught him this one, so maybe it doesn't belong on this list, but regardless, it's a favorite stew of mine, and I'd recommend it to anyone
                        with a pressure cooker. It's also maybe the easiest stew recipe I can think of--literally just throw in chicken (I usually just use skin-on chicken thighs), potatoes, tomatoes, an onion,
                        a couple of bay leaves, and salt and pepper, and let it cook for half an hour. The result is way more than the sum of its parts--the fat from the chicken infuses 
                        the entire stew with this wonderful, savory flavor that I really can't get enough of. As he points out, not too many American recipes will for you to stew skin on chicken like this--
                        typically you'd want to get it crispy somehow. But believe it or not, this works just as well, and makes half as many dishes.

                    By now I'm sure you're picking up on a theme with these recipes--Kenji clearly tries to make quick and easy recipes, without sacrifing flavor. He must be a practical sort of
                    cook, who understands that not everyone has seven or eight hours to make their tomato sauce. Well, I guess all of that is true, but none of it applies to this recipe. I've made this exactly
                    one time, and it was delicious, and I'm not sure if I'll ever make it again. The core idea is that if you cook your tomato sauce long enough, it will caramelize and give you
                    this extra rich, deep flavor. And yeah, it works, but it just takes forever! I'd recommend everyone trying this once, honestly, just for the experience of spending an entire day
                    on your tomato sauce. You'll definitely come out on the other side with a deeper appreciation for the art of sauce. But you'll have to decide for yourself if one time is enough.
